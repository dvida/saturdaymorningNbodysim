# Saturday Morning N-body Simulator
A simple N body simulator (with collisions) made one boring Saturday morning.

The inner planets of the Solar Systems are defined in the simulation. Upon running it you can see a 2D animation of their motion in the ecliptic plane.

For educational purposes only! (I doubt you can do anything useful with it).
